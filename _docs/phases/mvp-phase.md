### Key Components to Implement

#### RecordButton Component

```typescript
/**
 * @fileoverview Main recording control button component.
 *
 * Handles recording start/stop functionality with visual feedback.
 * Provides keyboard shortcuts and accessibility features.
 */

interface RecordButtonProps {
  isRecording: boolean;
  onStartRecording: () => void;
  onStopRecording: () => void;
  disabled?: boolean;
}

export const RecordButton: React.FC<RecordButtonProps> = ({
  isRecording,
  onStartRecording,
  onStopRecording,
  disabled = false,
}) => {
  // Recording button with state changes and animations
};
```

#### useRecording Hook

```typescript
/**
 * @fileoverview Video recording functionality hook.
 *
 * Manages MediaRecorder API, recording state, and file creation.
 * Provides comprehensive recording functionality for the application.
 */

export const useRecording = () => {
  // MediaRecorder setup and management
  // Recording state management
  // File creation and download
  // Error handling
};
```

#### Recording Service

```typescript
/**
 * @fileoverview MediaRecorder service for video recording.
 *
 * Handles MediaRecorder API configuration, recording lifecycle,
 * and file generation with proper error handling.
 */

export class RecordingService {
  // MediaRecorder configuration
  // Recording start/stop methods
  // File generation and download
  // Error handling and recovery
}
```
