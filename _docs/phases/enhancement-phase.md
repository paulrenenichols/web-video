### Key Components to Implement

#### FaceTracking Component

```typescript
/**
 * @fileoverview Main facial tracking component using MediaPipe.
 *
 * Integrates MediaPipe Face Detection for real-time facial landmark tracking.
 * Provides tracking data for overlay positioning and visualization.
 */

interface FaceTrackingProps {
  stream: MediaStream | null;
  onTrackingUpdate: (landmarks: FacialLandmarks) => void;
  showVisualization: boolean;
}

export const FaceTracking: React.FC<FaceTrackingProps> = ({ stream, onTrackingUpdate, showVisualization }) => {
  // MediaPipe integration
  // Real-time tracking
  // Visualization rendering
};
```

#### OverlaySystem Component

```typescript
/**
 * @fileoverview Main overlay management system.
 *
 * Coordinates overlay positioning, rendering, and state management.
 * Handles multiple overlays and their interactions.
 */

interface OverlaySystemProps {
  landmarks: FacialLandmarks | null;
  activeOverlays: OverlayType[];
  onOverlayUpdate: (overlays: OverlayData[]) => void;
}

export const OverlaySystem: React.FC<OverlaySystemProps> = ({ landmarks, activeOverlays, onOverlayUpdate }) => {
  // Overlay positioning
  // Canvas rendering
  // State management
};
```

#### useFaceTracking Hook

```typescript
/**
 * @fileoverview MediaPipe facial tracking hook.
 *
 * Manages MediaPipe Face Detection initialization, tracking,
 * and provides real-time facial landmark data.
 */

export const useFaceTracking = () => {
  // MediaPipe initialization
  // Real-time tracking
  // Performance optimization
  // Error handling
};
```
