# Phase 3 Enhancement: Step-by-Step Implementation Plan

## Overview

This plan breaks down the Phase 3 enhancement into 12 sequential steps, each representing a complete, testable feature. Each step builds upon the previous one, allowing for incremental testing and validation before proceeding to the next feature.

## Implementation Strategy

- **Incremental Development**: Each step is a complete, working feature
- **Test-Driven**: Each step can be tested independently before moving forward
- **Minimal Dependencies**: Each step has minimal dependencies on future steps
- **Rollback Capability**: If any step fails, we can easily rollback to the previous working state

## Rollback Strategy

If any step fails or causes issues:

1. **Immediate Rollback**: Revert to the previous working commit
2. **Analysis**: Identify the specific issue and root cause
3. **Simplification**: Break the failed step into smaller sub-steps
4. **Re-implementation**: Implement the feature with a simpler approach
5. **Validation**: Ensure the simplified version works before proceeding

## Dependencies Between Steps

- Steps 1-2: Foundation (can be implemented independently)
- Steps 3-5: Visualization (depends on steps 1-2)
- Steps 6-8: Overlay system (depends on steps 1-5)
- Steps 9-10: Advanced features (depends on steps 6-8)
- Steps 11-12: Integration and polish (depends on all previous steps)

## Estimated Timeline

- **Steps 1-2**: 1-2 days (foundation)
- **Steps 3-5**: 2-3 days (visualization)
- **Steps 6-8**: 3-4 days (basic overlays)
- **Steps 9-10**: 2-3 days (advanced features)
- **Steps 11-12**: 2-3 days (integration and polish)

**Total Estimated Time**: 10-15 days

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks

- **MediaPipe Integration Issues**: Start with basic detection before advanced features
- **Performance Problems**: Monitor performance at each step and optimize as needed
- **Browser Compatibility**: Test across different browsers early and often

### Development Risks

- **Scope Creep**: Stick to the defined scope for each step
- **Integration Issues**: Test integration points thoroughly at each step
- **User Experience**: Validate UX with simple implementations before adding complexity

## Next Steps

1. Review and approve this plan
2. Set up development environment for MediaPipe
3. Begin with Step 1: Basic MediaPipe Integration Setup
4. Test each step thoroughly before proceeding
5. Document any issues or deviations from the plan

This plan ensures that we can build the enhancement phase incrementally, with each step providing value and being testable before moving to the next feature.
