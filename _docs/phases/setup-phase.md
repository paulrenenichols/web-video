# Phase 1: Setup Phase

## Overview

This phase establishes the foundational structure and basic functionality of the video recording application. The goal is to create a minimal running framework that provides the basic infrastructure needed for subsequent phases.

## Phase Goals

- Set up the development environment and project structure
- Implement basic camera access and video display
- Create the foundational UI components
- Establish the basic state management system
- Ensure the application runs and displays camera feed

## Deliverables

- Working development environment with all tools configured
- Basic application that can access camera and display video feed
- Minimal UI with placeholder components
- Basic state management structure
- Project structure following established conventions

## Features and Tasks

### 1. Project Setup and Configuration

**Goal**: Establish the development environment and project structure

**Tasks**:

1. Initialize Vite + React + TypeScript project with proper configuration
2. Set up Tailwind CSS and Shadcn/ui with theme configuration
3. Configure ESLint, Prettier, and TypeScript with strict settings
4. Set up Docker and Docker Compose for development environment
5. Create basic project structure following established conventions

**Acceptance Criteria**:

- Project builds and runs without errors
- All development tools are properly configured
- Project structure matches defined conventions
- Docker environment is functional

### 2. Basic Camera Access

**Goal**: Implement fundamental camera functionality

**Tasks**:

1. Create basic camera access service using MediaDevices API
2. Implement camera permission handling and error states
3. Create basic video element component for camera display
4. Add camera selection functionality (if multiple cameras available)
5. Implement basic error handling for camera access failures

**Acceptance Criteria**:

- Application can request and receive camera permissions
- Camera feed displays in the application
- Multiple camera selection works (if available)
- Graceful error handling for permission denials

### 3. Foundation UI Components

**Goal**: Create the basic UI component structure

**Tasks**:

1. Set up Shadcn/ui components (Button, Card, Input, etc.)
2. Create basic layout components (Header, Main, Footer)
3. Implement video container component with proper styling
4. Create placeholder control panel component
5. Add basic responsive design structure

**Acceptance Criteria**:

- All basic UI components render correctly
- Layout is responsive and follows design system
- Video container displays camera feed properly
- Control panel placeholder is visible and styled

### 4. Basic State Management

**Goal**: Establish the state management foundation

**Tasks**:

1. Set up Zustand store structure for video state
2. Create basic video state interface and initial state
3. Implement camera state management (active/inactive)
4. Add basic error state management
5. Create store connection to UI components

**Acceptance Criteria**:

- State management system is functional
- Camera state is properly managed
- Error states are handled and displayed
- UI components can access and update state

### 5. Basic Application Structure

**Goal**: Create the main application component and entry point

**Tasks**:

1. Create main App component with proper structure
2. Implement basic routing structure (if needed)
3. Add error boundaries for error handling
4. Create loading states for application initialization
5. Implement basic accessibility features (ARIA labels, keyboard navigation)

**Acceptance Criteria**:

- Application loads and displays correctly
- Error boundaries catch and handle errors gracefully
- Loading states provide user feedback
- Basic accessibility features are implemented

## Technical Implementation

### Key Components to Implement

#### VideoPlayer Component

```typescript
/**
 * @fileoverview Basic video player component for camera display.
 *
 * Displays camera feed and handles basic video element functionality.
 * This is a foundational component that will be enhanced in later phases.
 */

interface VideoPlayerProps {
  stream: MediaStream | null;
  className?: string;
}

export const VideoPlayer: React.FC<VideoPlayerProps> = ({ stream, className }) => {
  // Basic video element with camera stream
};
```

#### useCamera Hook

```typescript
/**
 * @fileoverview Basic camera access hook.
 *
 * Handles camera permissions, stream access, and basic error states.
 * Provides foundation for more advanced camera functionality.
 */

export const useCamera = () => {
  // Camera access logic
  // Permission handling
  // Error states
};
```

#### Video Store

```typescript
/**
 * @fileoverview Basic video state management.
 *
 * Manages camera state, basic video configuration, and error states.
 * Foundation for more complex state management in later phases.
 */

interface VideoState {
  isCameraActive: boolean;
  stream: MediaStream | null;
  error: string | null;
  // Basic state properties
}
```

## Success Metrics

- [ ] Application builds and runs without errors
- [ ] Camera feed displays correctly
- [ ] Basic UI components render properly
- [ ] State management system is functional
- [ ] Error handling works for common scenarios
- [ ] Development environment is fully configured
- [ ] Project structure follows established conventions

## Dependencies

- Node.js and npm/pnpm
- Docker and Docker Compose
- Modern browser with camera support
- All development tools specified in tech stack

## Risks and Mitigation

- **Camera permission issues**: Implement proper error handling and user guidance
- **Browser compatibility**: Test on multiple browsers and provide fallbacks
- **Development environment setup**: Provide detailed setup documentation
- **Performance issues**: Monitor bundle size and implement basic optimizations

## Next Phase Preparation

This phase establishes the foundation for the MVP phase, which will add:

- Video recording functionality
- Basic recording controls
- File download capabilities
- Enhanced UI components

The setup phase ensures that all foundational elements are in place and working correctly before adding more complex features.
